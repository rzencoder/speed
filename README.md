# SPEED Typing

> Typing game based on the movie 'Speed'. Built using Vue, Vue-Cli and Sass.

## Instructions

Choose a target word per minute speed and start typing. The bomb will activate once you go 5 wpm above your target to allow a little breathing space. If your wpm falls below the target or you never reach the target the bomb will explode. Type all of the text to defuse the bomb.
